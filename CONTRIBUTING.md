Contributions to the Rcpp Gallery are very welcome. To encourage broad use in both open-source and commercial projects, all of the code in the Rcpp Gallery is published under the 
[MIT License](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE.txt). 

Rcpp Gallery articles are very straightforward to create and consist of a single source file (either C++ or R Markdown). There are two ways to contribute an article:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the Rcpp Gallery website and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) with your new or updated articles; or

2. Post your article on the web (e.g. using a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)) and then [submit an issue](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/issues/new) requesting that we include the article.

In either case, you can choose one of two authoring formats:

1. **Doxygen** &mdash; A C++ source file annotated with [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) comments that are converted into freestanding text when published to the web (for more details see [Doxygen-Articles](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/wiki/Doxygen-Articles)).

2. **R Markdown** &mdash; A source file that intermixes C++ and R code with markdown formatted text (for more details see [R-Markdown-Articles](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/wiki/R-Markdown-Articles)).

If you are submitting a pull request or want to preview what your article will look like once it's published, you'll likely want to clone the Rcpp Gallery repository and setup a local development configuration. Details on doing this are covered in the [Development-Setup](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/wiki/Development-Setup) article.
