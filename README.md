## Rcpp Gallery

The [Rcpp Gallery](http://gallery.rcpp.org) is a collection of community 
contributed articles and code examples that  illustrate techniques for using 
the [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html) package. The goal is 
to provide a forum for easy sharing of technical insights and methods of work. 
We hope this helps both beginners getting started with Rcpp as well as 
more advanced users who  glean insights from seeing how others approach
problems.

## Development

To setup a development configuration of the Rcpp Gallery website you should clone it to your local system and then follow the instructions in the [Development Setup](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/wiki/Development-Setup) article.

Contributions to the Rcpp Gallery are very welcome. For more information on contributing see the [Contributing to the Rcpp Gallery](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/wiki/Contributing-to-the-Rcpp-Gallery) article. To encourage broad use in both open-source and commercial projects, all of the code in the Rcpp Gallery is published under the
