## About

The *Rcpp Gallery* is a collection of community contributed code examples that 
illustrate techniques for using the [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html) package. 
The goal is to provide a forum for easy sharing of technical insights and methods
of work. We hope this helps both beginners getting started with Rcpp as well as 
more advanced users who  glean insights from seeing how others approach problems.

To encourage broad use in both open-source and commerical projects, all of 
the code in the Rcpp Gallery is published under the 
[MIT License]({{ site.baseurl }}LICENSE.txt).

If you are a user of Rcpp with code or insights you'd like to share, we'd 
love to hear from you. It's possible to contribute everything from a small
code snippet to a longer form article with supporting code. Please see 
[contributing to the Rcpp Gallery](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery/wiki/Contributing) for more details.

The source code for this website and all of the examples within it
is available [here](https://github.com/jjallaire/rcpp-gallery).
