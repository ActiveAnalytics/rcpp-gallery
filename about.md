## About

The *Rcpp Gallery* is  a collection of community contributed articles and code examples that illustrate techniques for programming with [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html). The goal is to provide a forum for easy sharing of technical insights and methods of work. We hope this helps both beginners to get started with Rcpp as well as advanced users to glean insights from seeing how others use Rcpp to solve more challenging problems.

To encourage broad use in both open-source and commercial projects, all of 
the code in the Rcpp Gallery is published under the 
[MIT License]({{ site.baseurl }}LICENSE.txt).

If you are a user of Rcpp with code or insights you'd like to share, we'd 
love to hear from you. It's possible to contribute everything from a small
code snippet to a longer form article with supporting code. Please see 
[contributing to the Rcpp Gallery]({{ site.repo }}/wiki/Contributing-to-the-Rcpp-Gallery) for more details.

The source code for this website and all of the examples within it
is available [here]({{ site.repo }}) (the
pages for individual articles also include a link to their source code).
