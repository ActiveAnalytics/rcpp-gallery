## About

The *Rcpp Gallery* is a collection of community contributed articles and code
examples that illustrate techniques for programming with
[Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html). The goal is to provide a
forum for easy sharing of technical insights and methods of work. We hope
this helps both beginners to get started with Rcpp as well as advanced users
to glean insights from seeing how others use Rcpp to solve more challenging
problems.

If you are a user of Rcpp with code or insights you'd like to share, we'd
love to hear from you. It's possible to contribute everything from a small
code snippet to a longer form article with supporting code. Please see
[contributing to the Rcpp Gallery]({{ site.repo }}/wiki/Contributing-to-the-Rcpp-Gallery) for more details.

The source code for this website and all of the articles within it is
available [here]({{ site.repo }}) (the individual articles also include a
link to their source code). The source code published in the Rcpp Gallery is
licensed under the [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) (or
later).

The gallery is published with 
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), 
styled using [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) and
[Pygments](http://pygments.org/),
and built with 
[R](http://www.r-project.org/), 
[Rcpp](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/Rcpp/), 
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), and
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
